=head1 NAME

File::System::Test - Module for testing file system drivers

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This suite of test subroutines will test if a file system object is internally consistent and can be used to test other features of the object.

The following tests are available:

=over

=item is_root_sane($obj, $name)

Checks to make sure the root file object is generally sane. It tests the
following:

=over

=item *

Is the root object defined?

=item *

Does the root subroutine of the root object represent the same path?

=item *

Is the path '/'?

=item *

Does stringify work correctly?

=item *

Does basename return ''?

=item *

Does dirname return '/'?

=item *

Does a lookup of '' exist? Does it represent the same path?

=item *

Does a lookup of '.' exist? Does it represent the same path?

=item *

Does a lookup of '..' exist? Does it represent the same path?

=item *

Does a lookup of '/' exist? Does it represent the same path?

=item *

Does is_root return true?

=item *

Is parent path the same as root path?

=item *

Does properties return at least basename, dirname, and path?

=item *

Does is_container return true?

This test performs the following:

=over

=item *

Is the object defined?

=item *

=item is_container_sane($obj, $name)

Runs additional container specific tests. It tests the following:

=item *

Does is_container return true?

=item *

Can the container C<has_children>?

=item *

Can the container C<children_paths>?

=item *

Can the container C<children>?

=item *

Can the container C<child>?

=item *

If not C<has_children>, does C<children_paths> return '.' and '..' only? Does C<children> return an empty list?

=item *

If the container C<has_children>, does C<children_paths> return '.' and '..' and more? Does C<children> return a non-empty list?

=item *

If the container C<has_children>, does each C<child> return an object for the same path as C<lookup>.

Checks to see if the given file object is writable and confirms that writing works as expected.

Check to see if is_readable and is_writable.

Can we write to the file handle returned by open("w")?

Does the file handle close properly?

Is the content of the file the same as written?

=item *

Check to see if is_appendable. If so, write one more line to the end, close and reopen to check that the file is as expected.

=item *

Check to see if is_seekable. If so, seek into the middle, overwrite part of the file, close andreopen to check that the file is as expected.

Checks to make sure that after each of these operations that the entire subtree is preserved.
