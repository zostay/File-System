1.16    2005-12-03 16:34    Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp

    * t/07_layered.t: Added additional tests to reveal a bug that causes
      the root-level of the layered file systems to be treated as in the current
      directory during calls to children(), children_paths(), and
      has_children().
    * lib/File/System/Layered.pm: Paths passed to lookup() are normalized as
      they should be.
    * lib/File/System/Layered.pm: Updated has_children(), children_paths(),
      children(), and child() so that they will treat layers besides the current
      properly.
    * lib/File/System/Object.pm: Updated has_content() and is_container() to
      make sure they always return a scalar.
    * lib/File/System/Test.pm: Improved the diagnostics messages of most
      methods in File::System::Test so that it is more obvious which part of a
      test failed.

1.15	2005-11-22 09:58	Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp

	* lib/File/System/Real.pm: Added more croaking when open() and opendir()
	  failures occur to make errors a little more explicit.
    * lib/File/System/Object.pm: Fixed a bug where the glob() method would
      incorrectly call children_paths() on non-containers. This caused parts of
      the File::System::Table tests to fail since it depends upon the generic
      glob() implementation due to the improved error handling in
      File::System::Real.
    * lib/File/System/Real.pm: Removed a remaining call to
      File::Basename::dirname() that should have already been replaced with
      dirname_of_path().
    * lib/File/System/Table.pm: Added better debugging information to the
      methods generated by an eval.
    * lib/File/System/Object.pm: Rearranged the module author documentation to
      make it more accessible and make the docs easier for non-module authors
      to read.
    * lib/File/System/Object.pm, lib/File/System.pm: Moved the section titled
      "FILE SYSTEM MODULE AUTHORS" out of File::System::Object and into
      File::System titled "VIRTUAL FILE SYSTEM" with some modifications.

1.14	2005-09-26 21:05	Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp

	* FIXED [cpan #14771] t/01_normalize_path.t, lib/File/System/Object.pm:
	  Fixed a tiny off-by-one error that caused ".."'s to be mistreated by the
	  normalize_path() method.
	* FIXED [cpan #13514] lib/File/System/Object.pm, lib/File/System/Table.pm,
	  lib/File/System/Test.pm, lib/File/System/Real.pm: Removed basename/dirname
	  calculations using the Perl File::Basename package. There's some
	  controversy about the correct way to do this and the docs already specify
	  that we do things the way Unix likes too anyway. That'll keep things
	  consistent. Thanks to Zev Benjamin for the heads up.

1.13	2005-06-21 09:31	Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp

	* lib/File/System/Object.pm: Removed the Parse::RecDescent parser grammar
	  that is used with the internal globber.
	* lib/File/System/Globber.PL: At build time this script generates a file
	  named lib/File/System/Globber.pm containing the precompiled parser
	  grammar, which ought to save a fraction of a second that was spend parsing
	  the grammar and then compiling the Perl generated. Now, it just needs to
	  compile the generated Perl.

1.12	2005-06-08 21:26	Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp

	* lib/File/System/Passthrough.pm: Updated the passthrough driver so that
	  want subroutine passed to find() is passed objects of the same type as the
	  current object, rather than objects of the wrapped type. This behavior is
	  more consistent and allows a derivation to add new methods that the
	  wrapped object may not have.

1.11	2005-05-19 09:37	Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp

	* lib/File/System/Layered.pm: Fixed find(), which was returning strange
	  results in some of the layers did not contain an entry for a directory.

1.10	2005-05-18 20:53	Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp

	* t/03_real.t, t/04_table_basic.t, t/05_table_multimount.t,
	  t/06_table_mount.t, t/07_layered.t, t/08_passthrough.t: Added tests for
	  find() and glob() for directories within the root.
	* lib/File/System/Layered.pm: Fixed a bug that occurred when trying to glob
	  a directory that existed in some, but not all roots.
	* lib/File/System/Object.pm: Corrected the way that glob() works so that it
	  actually works.
	* lib/File/System/Test.pm: Corrected the test suite to allow for testing of
	  glob() and find() not in the root.
	* lib/File/System/Real.pm: Altered glob() to use File::Glob::bsd_glob()
	  which doesn't split globs on whitespace.

1.09	2005-05-18 08:50	Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp

	* lib/File/System/Layered.pm: Fixed a find() bug that caused it to fail to
	  ever return when a path was passed (instead of using $self).
	* lib/File/System/Object.pm: Fixed a find() bug that caused it to fail to
	  return anything when a path was passed (instead of using $self).
	* lib/File/System/Test.pm: Created additional tests within
	  is_glob_and_find_consistent() to check that find() properly handles passed
	  paths and that glob() works the same from the root as from a local object.

1.08	2005-05-08 21:39	Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp

	* lib/File/System.pm: This is repository fix because of a missed commit from
	  1.06.

1.07	2005-05-08 21:38	Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp

	* lib/File/System/Object.pm: Results of glob() and find() sorted.
	* lib/File/System/Real.pm: Results of glob() sorted.

1.06	2005-04-30 17:25	Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp

	* lib/File/System/Object.pm: Improved the "ne", "eq", and "cmp" operators
	  through the use of some extra (and currently undocumented) methods.

1.05	2005-04-28 10:36	Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp

	* lib/File/System/Passthrough.pm: Added a passthrough driver that doesn't do
	  anything on it's own. It's useful for subclassing.
	* t/08_passthrough.t: Copied the tests from t/03_real.t and modified the
	  call to the constructor.

1.04	2005-04-23 09:39	Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp

	* Build.PL: Added support for Makefile.PL compatibility.

1.03	2005-04-16 23:17	Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp

	* ilb/File/System/Real.pm: Added an error check to the is_creatable()
	  method.
	* lib/File/System/Layered.pm: Added the guts to File::System::Layered
	* t/07_layered.t: Added tests for File::System::Layered

	* lib/File/System.pm: Fixed the POD abstract to meaningful for the whole
	  File-System package.
	* lib/File/System/Table.pm: Fixed a documentation bug that refered to
	  mkfile() still and replaeced it with a reference to create().
	* lib/File/System/Layered.pm: Created a shell with documentation only.

1.02	2005-04-16 12:32	Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp

	* lib/File/System/Object.pm: Changed API again to add the create() method to
	  replace the old (and inconsistent) mkdir/mfile methods.
	* lib/File/System/Object.pm: Added the is_creatable() method to the API.
	* lib/File/System/Real.pm: Removed the "special" methods mkdir() and
	  mkfile() and replaced them with create() and added is_creatable().
	* lib/File/System/Table.pm: Removed the mkdir() and mkfile() methods and
	  replaced them with create() and added is_creatable().
	* t/03_real.t: Altered tests for API changes.
	* t/04_table_basic.t: Altered tests for API changes.
	* t/05_table_multimount.t: Altered tests for API changes.
	* t/06_table_mount.t: Altered tests for API changes.

	* lib/File/System/Table: Altered the exists method to fit the new
	  requirements.
	* t/04_table_basic.t: Altered this test to use the new test suite.
	* t/05_table_multimount.t: Added this test to test starting mounts.

	* *: Refactored the canonify method by renaming it to normalize_path.
	* *: Refactored the canonify_real method by renaming it to
	  normalize_real_path.
	* t/01_canonify.t: Renamed to t/01_normalize_path.t

1.02	2005-04-08 08:46	Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp

	* lib/File/System/Test.pm: Finished the initial version of the test suite.
	* t/03_real.t: Altered this test to use the new test suite.
	* lib/File/System/Object.pm: Added a new requirement for module authors that
	  the exists method should fallback to $self->path if none given. Added the
	  necessary to the exists method to do that.
	* lib/File/System/Real.pm: Altered exists for new requirement.
	* lib/File/System/Object.pm: The canonify method complains if it is given
	  undef for a path.
	* lib/File/System.pm: The factory method croaks better error messages.

1.02	2005-04-06 20:57	Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp

	* lib/File/System/Object.pm: Removed documentation for mkdir/mkfile API.
	  We'll just pretend they don't exist for now. :)
	* lib/File/System/Real.pm: Added documentation for the special methods,
	  mkdir and mkfile.
	* lib/File/System/Test.pm: Added a special test suite to help validate the
