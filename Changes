1.12	2005-06-08 21:26	Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp

	* lib/File/System/Passthrough.pm: Updated the passthrough driver so that
	  want subroutine passed to find() is passed objects of the same type as the
	  current object, rather than objects of the wrapped type. This behavior is
	  more consistent and allows a derivation to add new methods that the
	  wrapped object may not have.

1.11	2005-05-19 09:37	Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp

	* lib/File/System/Layered.pm: Fixed find(), which was returning strange
	  results in some of the layers did not contain an entry for a directory.

1.10	2005-05-18 20:53	Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp

	* t/03_real.t, t/04_table_basic.t, t/05_table_multimount.t,
	  t/06_table_mount.t, t/07_layered.t, t/08_passthrough.t: Added tests for
	  find() and glob() for directories within the root.
	* lib/File/System/Layered.pm: Fixed a bug that occurred when trying to glob
	  a directory that existed in some, but not all roots.
	* lib/File/System/Object.pm: Corrected the way that glob() works so that it
	  actually works.
	* lib/File/System/Test.pm: Corrected the test suite to allow for testing of
	  glob() and find() not in the root.
	* lib/File/System/Real.pm: Altered glob() to use File::Glob::bsd_glob()
	  which doesn't split globs on whitespace.

1.09	2005-05-18 08:50	Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp

	* lib/File/System/Layered.pm: Fixed a find() bug that caused it to fail to
	  ever return when a path was passed (instead of using $self).
	* lib/File/System/Object.pm: Fixed a find() bug that caused it to fail to
	  return anything when a path was passed (instead of using $self).
	* lib/File/System/Test.pm: Created additional tests within
	  is_glob_and_find_consistent() to check that find() properly handles passed
	  paths and that glob() works the same from the root as from a local object.

1.08	2005-05-08 21:39	Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp

	* lib/File/System.pm: This is repository fix because of a missed commit from
	  1.06.

1.07	2005-05-08 21:38	Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp

	* lib/File/System/Object.pm: Results of glob() and find() sorted.
	* lib/File/System/Real.pm: Results of glob() sorted.

1.06	2005-04-30 17:25	Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp

	* lib/File/System/Object.pm: Improved the "ne", "eq", and "cmp" operators
	  through the use of some extra (and currently undocumented) methods.

1.05	2005-04-28 10:36	Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp

	* lib/File/System/Passthrough.pm: Added a passthrough driver that doesn't do
	  anything on it's own. It's useful for subclassing.
	* t/08_passthrough.t: Copied the tests from t/03_real.t and modified the
	  call to the constructor.

1.04	2005-04-23 09:39	Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp

	* Build.PL: Added support for Makefile.PL compatibility.

	  method.
	* lib/File/System/Layered.pm: Added the guts to File::System::Layered
	* t/07_layered.t: Added tests for File::System::Layered

	* lib/File/System.pm: Fixed the POD abstract to meaningful for the whole
	  File-System package.
	* lib/File/System/Table.pm: Fixed a documentation bug that refered to
	  mkfile() still and replaeced it with a reference to create().
	* lib/File/System/Layered.pm: Created a shell with documentation only.

1.02	2005-04-16 12:32	Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp

	* lib/File/System/Object.pm: Changed API again to add the create() method to
	  replace the old (and inconsistent) mkdir/mfile methods.
	* lib/File/System/Object.pm: Added the is_creatable() method to the API.
	* lib/File/System/Real.pm: Removed the "special" methods mkdir() and
	  mkfile() and replaced them with create() and added is_creatable().
	* lib/File/System/Table.pm: Removed the mkdir() and mkfile() methods and
	  replaced them with create() and added is_creatable().
	* t/03_real.t: Altered tests for API changes.
	* t/04_table_basic.t: Altered tests for API changes.
	* t/05_table_multimount.t: Altered tests for API changes.
	* t/06_table_mount.t: Altered tests for API changes.
	* lib/File/System.pm: Updated the documentation.

1.02	2005-04-10 21:15	Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp

	* lib/File/System/Table: Altered the exists method to fit the new
	  requirements.
	* t/04_table_basic.t: Altered this test to use the new test suite.
	* t/05_table_multimount.t: Added this test to test starting mounts.
	* t/06_table_mount.t: Added this test to test mount table changes.
	* *: Refactored the canonify method by renaming it to normalize_path.
	* *: Refactored the canonify_real method by renaming it to
	  normalize_real_path.
	* t/01_canonify.t: Renamed to t/01_normalize_path.t

1.02	2005-04-08 08:46	Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp

	* lib/File/System/Test.pm: Finished the initial version of the test suite.
	* t/03_real.t: Altered this test to use the new test suite.
	* lib/File/System/Object.pm: Added a new requirement for module authors that
	  the exists method should fallback to $self->path if none given. Added the
	  necessary to the exists method to do that.
	* lib/File/System/Real.pm: Altered exists for new requirement.
	* lib/File/System/Object.pm: The canonify method complains if it is given
	  undef for a path.
	* lib/File/System.pm: The factory method croaks better error messages.

1.02	2005-04-06 20:57	Andrew Sterling Hanenkamp

	* lib/File/System/Object.pm: Removed documentation for mkdir/mkfile API.
	  We'll just pretend they don't exist for now. :)
	* lib/File/System/Real.pm: Added documentation for the special methods,
	  mkdir and mkfile.
	* lib/File/System/Test.pm: Added a special test suite to help validate the
	  creation of new file system drivers.
